You will implement an input stream to process data from the file.
Please also implement a util class to check a file and return a ciphered text.

Please implement methods in the CipherCreator.

    - public static StringBuilder cipherText(File input) - takes a file as an input and returns a ciphered text.

Please override methods in the TransformerInputStream class.

    - public int read() - reads the next data byte and returns a ciphered byte.
    - public void close() - closes the stream and prints a message about it to the console.

Cipher key points:

  1. The text can only contain letters, and each word is written on a new line.
  2. Each letter of the ciphered text is shifted by two characters from the original one, case sensitive. A -> C, f ->h.
  3. The alphabet is looped. It means Z -> B, y -> a.
  4. All other characters are ignored.
